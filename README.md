# Movie-Trailer-Project-Udacity
For Udacity course

This project allows the user to create their very own website that contains information about their favorite films. The project creates 
a simple webpage that displays the name, poster image, and a short trailer from each movie (the trailer plays when a movie poster is 
clicked)that the user specifies. 

# Installation Instructions:

git clone https://github.com/tomh17/Movie-Trailer-Project-Udacity.git

# How it Works

First, upload the appropriate files as listed above. You will need media.py, entertainment_center.py, as well as fresh_tomatoes.py.

From there, go to the media.py file and begin creating instances of the class "Movie" (Class "Movie" is in the file media.py) using 
information from your favorite films. 

After creating multiple instances of the class movie and filling in the information from each of your favorite movies, place those 
class instances in the variable title "movies" at the bottom of media.py. From there, run the program media.py and the three combined python 
documents will render a website containing all of your favorite movies.
